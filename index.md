# Welcome to my Portfolio 👋

Hi, I'm **ZGr3Y**!
Here I showcase my projects and coding experiments, with a focus on Web Security.

## 🚀 Web Security Projects

### CTF Vulnerability Lab (Bachelor's Thesis)
An offensive security training platform built with Docker and Node.js. I developed three isolated services simulating real-world vulnerabilities (IDOR with bypassable WAF, JWT Injection, and Weak Cryptography) to allow students to practice exploitation techniques in a controlled environment.

### Broken Access Control & Mitigations
A research project focused on the #1 vulnerability in the OWASP Top 10. The application demonstrates practical cases of IDOR and insecure JWT implementations, while providing a parallel "Hardened" version of the code featuring rigorous validation, secure session management, and AES-256 encryption.
